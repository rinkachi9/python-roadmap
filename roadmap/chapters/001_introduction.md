# Introduction to Python

## What is Python?

Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. It is designed to emphasize code readability
and simplicity, making it an excellent choice for beginners and experienced developers alike. Python supports multiple
programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. It has a dynamic type system
and automatic memory management, which makes it highly flexible and user-friendly.

## Why Use Python?

Python is widely adopted for several reasons:

- **Readable and concise syntax** that reduces development time and improves maintainability.
- **Large standard library** that provides tools and modules for a wide variety of tasks.
- **Extensive ecosystem of third-party packages**, such as NumPy, Pandas, Flask, Django, and TensorFlow.
- **Strong community support** with rich documentation, tutorials, and active forums.
- **Cross-platform compatibility**, allowing developers to write code once and run it anywhere.
- **Integration capabilities** with other languages like C, C++, Java, and with tools like databases, web services, and
  GUI toolkits.
- **Popular in academia and industry**, making it valuable for data science, machine learning, web development,
  automation, scripting, and more.

## Python usage

Python is used in a wide range of fields and industries:

- **Web Development** – using frameworks like Django, Flask, and FastAPI.
- **Data science and machine learning** – with libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.
- **Automation and scripting** – for writing scripts to automate repetitive tasks.
- **DevOps and infrastructure** – for writing configuration tools, CI/CD scripts, and cloud automation.
- **Desktop application development** – using frameworks like PyQt, Tkinter, and Kivy.
- **Embedded systems and IoT** – with MicroPython and CircuitPython.
- **Game development** – using libraries like Pygame.
- **Cybersecurity** – for writing tools, automating tasks, and analyzing threats.
- **Education** – as the preferred language for introducing programming.

## Brief history

Python was created by **Guido van Rossum** and first released in **1991**. Its development was influenced by the ABC
language and emphasized code readability and developer productivity.

Key milestones:

- **1991** – Python 0.9.0 released.
- **2000** – Python 2.0 released with new features like garbage collection and list comprehensions.
- **2008** – Python 3.0 released, introducing major changes and improvements.
- **2020** – Python 2 reached end-of-life.

Today, Python is maintained by the **Python Software Foundation (PSF)** and is one of the most popular and widely used
programming languages in the world.

## Core concepts

| Category                   | Concept                | Description                                                                                      |
|----------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Syntax & structure**     | Indentation            | Python uses indentation (not braces) to define code blocks. Indentation consistency is critical. |
|                            | Comments               | Single-line (`#`) and multi-line (`'''` or `"""`) comments for documentation.                    |
| **Variables & data types** | Variables              | Dynamically typed — no need to declare types explicitly.                                         |
|                            | Data Types             | `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`, `list`, `tuple`, `set`, `dict`, `NoneType`.                       |
|                            | Type Conversion        | Use functions like `int()`, `str()`, `float()`, etc.                                             |
| **Control flow**           | Conditional Statements | `if`, `elif`, `else` for decision making.                                                        |
|                            | Loops                  | `for` and `while` loops for iteration.                                                           |
|                            | Loop Control           | `break`, `continue`, `pass`.                                                                     |
| **Functions**              | Defining Functions     | `def` keyword; understanding parameters and return values.                                       |
|                            | Arguments              | Positional, keyword, default, `*args`, and `**kwargs`.                                           |
|                            | Scope                  | Local vs global variables; `global` and `nonlocal` keywords.                                     |
| **Data structures**        | Lists                  | Ordered, mutable sequences.                                                                      |
|                            | Tuples                 | Ordered, immutable sequences.                                                                    |
|                            | Sets                   | Unordered collections of unique elements.                                                        |
|                            | Dictionaries           | Key-value pairs, mutable and unordered (but ordered in Python 3.7+).                             |
| **String handling**        | String Operations      | Concatenation, interpolation (`f-strings`), slicing, methods like `.upper()`, `.replace()`, etc. |
